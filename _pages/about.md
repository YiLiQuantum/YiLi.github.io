I am currently working toward the PhD degree in Quantum Optics and Quantum Information with the Department of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China. My research interests include the mathematical foundation of the quantum theory and its application in quantum information processing. I enjoy working about randomness certification, measurement incompatibility, error mitigation as well as quantum states characterization with Prof. Qiongyi He. In 2021, I received the Bachelor degree in the Department of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China. I also enjoyed studying the orbital angular momentum system in the laboratory supervised by Prof. Yongnan Li.
